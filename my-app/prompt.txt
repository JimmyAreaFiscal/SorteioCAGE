You are a React developer. 

I need you to generate an WebApp called "Sorteio das Divis√µes - CAGE-RS". 
This webapp should:

1. List all employees (from a previous specified csv, inside the package), each one in cards ("choosebox"), which have its photo (from assets/personal_photos), an box to choose between previous defined places to work. Also, it should have a buttom to "confirm" the choose, which will update the sidebar.

2. List all guesses made (presented in the csv) on the sidebar, with a ranking of top 5 guessers. After each employee chosen, the ranking should be updated, with a visual interaction of the line of the ranking going down or up. 

3. Being able to filter the choosenboxes (the cards) by the name of the employee using a search box filter. 

4. Saving each choosen in an internal database(SQLite), in order to not lose after updating the page. 


This should be created on the componentes "choosebox" (for the cards), "searchbar" (for the search and filter bar) and "sidebar" (for the sidebar with ranking). Also update the App.jsx.


In addition, make it graphically good, in order to be similar to a nowadays app.
